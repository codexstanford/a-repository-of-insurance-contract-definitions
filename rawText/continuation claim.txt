means any claim for ongoing Treatment for a Condition which has already been claimed for under this policy and which can be linked back to the original claim. If two or more claims are initially assessed as separate Conditions then later recognised as a continuation/recurring/or Bilateral Condition and/or claim, We will combine each related claim and consider as one Condition. The total amounts paid for each related claim shall then be deducted from the Benefit Limit applicable. Should this result in the Benefit Limit being reached or exceeded, no further claims for that Condition will be paid and any overpayment will be requested back and/or deducted from any future claims.
