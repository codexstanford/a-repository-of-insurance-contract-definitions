Accidental combustion caused by an external heat source, such as a spark or candle. ‘Fire’ does not include scorching, melting, or heat distortion of any kind unless as a direct result of combustion. If there is no combustion but a single event (caused suddenly and unexpectedly by an outside force) leads to scorching, melting or heat distortion you may be able to claim for this if your policy includes cover for accidental damage.
