• Staff Dishonesty cover works on a Losses Discovered basis. This means that loss due to theft or fraud that is discovered during the period of insurance and arising from circumstances that occurred on and/or after the retroactive date and within the Republic of South Africa are covered. • The retroactive date is either the inception date of this Staff Dishonesty cover or can be an agreed date in the past if the policyholder wants to be covered for potential staff dishonesty that happened before the inception date. • The retroactive date and inception date for each section of Staff Dishonesty cover is noted on the Coversheet. Scenario: The inception date is 1 January 2016, which means that the client can submit a claim to MiWay for theft or fraud discovered after 1 January 2016 for as long as the cover is in force. If the agreed retroactive date of the policy is 1 January 2015, the theft or fraudulent act must have occurred on or after 1 January 2015 otherwise it won’t be covered under this policy.
