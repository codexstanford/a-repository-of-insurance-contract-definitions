means : A. The vehicle or vehicles described on the Coverage Selections Page. B. Any auto while used as a temporary substitute for the described auto while that auto is out of normal use because of a breakdown, repair, servicing, loss or destruction. But the term “your auto” does not include a substitute vehicle owned by you or your spouse. C. A private passenger auto, trailer, motorcycle, pick-up truck, van or similar vehicle, to which you take title or lease as a permanent replacement for a described auto or as an additional auto. We provide coverage for an additional auto only if you ask us to insure it within seven days after you take title or the effective date of the lease. If a replacement or additional auto is a pick-up truck, van or similar vehicle, it must not be used for the delivery or transportation of goods or materials unless such use is incidental to your business of installing, maintaining or repairing furnishings or equipment. Under Parts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 the term “your auto” also includes any trailer not described on the Coverage Selections Page as covered under those Parts.
