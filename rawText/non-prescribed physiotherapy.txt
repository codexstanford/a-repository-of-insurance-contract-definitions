refers to treatment by a registered physiotherapist where referral by a medical practitioner has not been obtained prior to undergoing treatment. Where this benefit applies, cover is limited to the number of sessions indicated in the Table of Benefits. Additional sessions required over and above this limit must be prescribed in order for cover to continue; these sessions will be subject to the prescribed physiotherapy benefit limit. Physiotherapy (either prescribed, or a combination of non-prescribed and prescribed treatment) is initially restricted to 12 sessions per condition, after which the treatment must be reviewed by the referring medical practitioner. Should further sessions be required, a progress report must be submitted to the COMPANY, which indicates the medical necessity for any further treatment. Physiotherapy does not include therapies such as Rolfing, Massage, Pilates, Fango and Milta therapy.
