refers to products prescribed by a physician for the treatment of a confirmed diagnosis or medical condition, or to compensate vital bodily substances including, but not limited to, insulin, hypodermic needles or syringes. The prescribed drugs must be clinically proven to be effective for the condition and recognized by the pharmaceutical regulator in a given country. Prescribed drugs do not legally have to be prescribed by a physician in order to be purchased in the country where the INSURED PERSON is located; however, a prescription must be obtained for these costs to be considered eligible.
