is an optional level of cover and where provided will be shown in the Table of Benefits. This benefit means that if the necessary treatment for which the INSURED PERSON is covered is not available locally, he/she can choose to be medically evacuated to his/her home country for treatment, instead of to the nearest appropriate medical center. This only applies when his/her home country is located within his/her geographical area of cover. 	 Following completion of treatment, the COMPANY will also cover the cost of the return trip, at economy rates, to the INSURED PERSONâ€™s principal country of residence. The return journey must be made within one month after treatment has been completed. 	 INSURED PERSONS must contact Allianz Insurance Company at the first indication that repatriation is required. From this point onwards Allianz Insurance Company will organize and coordinate all stages of the repatriation until the INSURED PERSON is safely received into care at their destination. In the event that repatriation services are not organized by Allianz Insurance Company, the COMPANY reserves the right to decline all costs incurred.
