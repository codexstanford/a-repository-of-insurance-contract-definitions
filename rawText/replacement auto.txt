means an auto that permanently replaces an auto shown on the declarations page. A replacement auto will have the same coverage as the auto it replaces if the replacement auto is not covered by any other insurance policy. However, if the auto being replaced had coverage under Part IV—Damage To A Vehicle, such coverage will apply to the replacement auto only during the first 30 days after you become the owner unless you notify us within that 30-day period that you want us to extend coverage beyond the initial 30 days. If the auto being replaced did not have coverage under Part IV—Damage To A Vehicle, such coverage may be added, but the replacement auto will have no coverage under Part IV until you notify us of the replacement auto and ask us to add the coverage.
