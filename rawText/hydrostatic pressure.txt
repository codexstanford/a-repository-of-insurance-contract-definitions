Pressure exerted by a fluid due to gravity. An example of where hydrostatic pressure may cause damage to your property is where you have emptied your in-ground fibreglass swimming pool for maintenance purposes and there is heavy rainwater or a flood. If the pressure exerted on the empty pool by water which has soaked into the surrounding ground, exceeds the weight of the empty pool, it can cause it to ‘pop’ out of the ground.
