There are reasonable prospects of success if, at all times during your legal action against your opponent or dispute arising from an HMRC enquiry, it is more likely than not that: • a court or employment tribunal would: i decide the legal action under Parts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 in your favour (this includes making a successful appeal or successfully defending an appeal following a decision made in respect of your claim by a court); or ii award you a more favourable settlement than has already been offered by your opponent; or • you will be successful in resolving, in your favour, the dispute arising from the HMRC enquiry under Part 9. • if you are seeking damages from your opponent, you will recover them. We explain in more detail how we will decide if your legal action has reasonable prospects of success under ‘Important information about reasonable prospects of success’ on page 53 of this Section.
