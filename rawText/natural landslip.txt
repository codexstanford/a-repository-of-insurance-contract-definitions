The movement of ground forming materials that, before movement, formed an integral part of the ground. Such materials might be one or more of natural rock, soil, or artificial fill. ‘Movement’ means any one or more of falling, sliding, or flowing. Movement of ground due to below-ground subsidence, soil expansion, soil shrinkage, soil compaction or erosion is not a natural landslip.
