Wind speeds with gusts of at least 47mph/ 75kmh or torrential rainfall at a rate of at least 25mm/one inch per hour or snow to a depth of at least one foot/30cm in 24 hours or hail of such intensity that it causes damage to hard surfaces or breaks glass.
---
Violent wind (including cyclones and tornadoes), thunderstorms or hail which may be accompanied by rainwater or snow.
---
Rain and/or hail and/or snow (including weight of snow) and/or strong winds of 41Knots/47mph or more (Beaufort Scale number 9)
---
An unusual weather event with persistent high winds usually associated with rain, thunder, lightning or snow. The wind speed or gust should normally exceed 55mph (48 knots) to be a ‘storm’ but we take other factors into consideration such as where the property is sited. A storm can highlight defects rather than cause them and damage due to lack of maintenance, wear and tear or which happens gradually is not covered.
---
Strong winds in excess of 47 knots (54 MPH) that may be accompanied by heavy rain, snow or sleet, prolonged rainfall and weight of snow.
---
Strong winds in excess of 47 knots (54 MPH) that may be accompanied by heavy rain, snow or sleet.
---
A violent gale force 10 on the Beaufort scale reaching wind speeds of 55 mph or above and/or 25mm or more of rainfall in any 24-hour period, and/or snow to a depth of at least 1 ft (300mms) in 24-hours and/or hail of such intensity that it causes damage to hard surfaces or breaks glass, according to Our weather data.
---
Wind speeds with gusts of at least 47mph/ 75kmh or torrential rainfall at a rate of at least 25mm/one inch per hour or snow to a depth of at least one foot/30cm in 24 hours or hail of such intensity that it causes damage to hard surfaces or breaks glass.
---
means violent winds sometimes combined with thunder, heavy falls of rain, hail or snow. Bad weather, or heavy or persistent rain, does not by itself constitute a storm.

An unusual weather event with persistent high winds usually associated with rain, thunder, lightning or snow.
---
A violent atmospheric event with strong winds in excess of 47 knots that may be accompanied by heavy rain, snow or sleet.

We consider storm to be a period of violent weather defined as: • Wind speeds with gusts of at least 48 knots (55mph); or • Torrential rainfall at a rate of at least 25mm per hour; or • Snow to a depth of at least one foot (30 cms) in 24 hours; or • Hail of such intensity that it causes damage to hard surfaces or breaks glass.
