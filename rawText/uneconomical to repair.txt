means when the cost of repairs to us less the salvage value is greater than the: • replacement cost – where a total loss gives you the right to a replacement vehicle under the policy; or • agreed value – if your vehicle is insured for an agreed value; • market value – if your vehicle is insured for market value; or • market value or $5,000, whichever is the lesser – if your vehicle is insured under the uninsured motorist’s extension or Third Party Fire and Theft, unless otherwise notified to you by us in writing.
