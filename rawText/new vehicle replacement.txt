means the replacement of your vehicle with a new one of the same specification. This cover may apply, if you prefer, if the vehicle is deemed a total loss by us following a covered loss within 24 months from the date of first registration. The cost of the replacement vehicle must not exceed the agreed value during the first policy period. Past the first renewal date of your policy the cost of the replacement vehicle may exceed the agreed value if we deem it necessary to meet our obligation to you. You must be the first registered owner of the vehicle (other than a dealership) for this cover to apply. If you are not the first registered owner of the vehicle (other than a dealership) then new vehicle replacement only applies if the vehicle is less than 12 months old.
