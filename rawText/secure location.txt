A. A place which is enclosed and lockable, used to prevent intrusion and protect from harm or loss. B. A structure protected by professional security personnel or the Insured. To give you some examples of what we mean when refer to a Secured Location. We mean something like a locked room, locked building, garage, storage unit, safe or cabinet. It is somewhere you can leave an item unattended and it cannot be stolen without breaking and entering taking place.
