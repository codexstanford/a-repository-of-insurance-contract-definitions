Cover on a claims made basis refers to any claim made against the policyholder or Covered Party during the period of insurance. Cover that works on a claims made basis is different to cover that works on a losses occurring basis. A vehicle insurance policy is generally on a losses occurring basis, which means that any incident that occurs during the period of insurance is covered.
