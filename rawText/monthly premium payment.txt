means we have received payment from you of the full monthly premium amount shown on your Certificate of Insurance. Our policy is an annual policy which commences on the date we agree with you. We will issue you with this booklet and a Certificate of Insurance which will show the commencement and end date of the policy. We only accept premium payment monthly, not on an annual basis.
