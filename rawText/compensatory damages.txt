means a sum of money awarded in a civil action by a court to indemnify a person for a particular loss, detriment, or injury suffered as a result of the unlawful conduct of another. Compensatory damages provide a plaintiff with the monetary amount necessary to replace what was lost, and nothing more. They are distinguished from punitive damages, which punish a defendant for his or her conduct as a deterrent to future commission of such acts.
