Where medical opinion is required, Zurich will accept that of its Chief Medical Officer or a physician that currently holds an appointment as a consultant by a hospital in Ireland or the United Kingdom. In the event of a dispute with you, Zurich will seek the opinion of an appropriate independent physician. Zurich will not accept the opinion of any medical expert normally operating outside the territorial limits.
