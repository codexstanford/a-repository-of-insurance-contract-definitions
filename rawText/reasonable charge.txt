means a charge which is the lower of: (i) the medical provider’s usual charge for furnishing the TREATMENT, service or supply; or (ii) the charge which WE determine to be the general rate charged by others who render or furnish such TREATMENTs, services or supplies to persons: (a) who reside in the same area (as determined by US); and (b) whose INJURY or ILLNESS is comparable in nature and severity. WE will determine the USUAL, REASONABLE AND CUSTOMARY CHARGE for a TREATMENT, service or supply that is unusual, or not often provided in the area, or that is provided by only a small number of medical providers in the area. WE will consider such factors as: complexity; degree of skill needed; type of specialist required; range of services or supplies provided by a facility; and the prevailing charge in other areas. In the following cases, the maximum charge must not exceed: (i) an assistant surgeon: 20% of the primary surgeon’s fee; and (ii) an anaesthesiologist: 30% of primary surgeon’s fee.
