Whenever Claims Settlement is declared to be on a Reinstatement Basis, the basis upon which the amount payable in respect of the Property insured is to be calculated will be as follows: a the rebuilding or replacement of Property lost or destroyed which provided Our liability is not increased may be carried out;  i in any manner suitable to Your requirements; or  ii upon another site; b the repair or restoration of Property damaged, in either case to a condition equivalent to or substantially the same as but not better or more extensive than its condition when new.  Special Conditions i Our liability for the repair or restoration of Property damaged in part only will not exceed the amount which would have been payable had such Property been wholly destroyed. ii If at the time of reinstatement the sum representing 85% of the cost which would have been incurred in reinstating the whole of the Property covered by any item subject to this Policy Definition exceeds its Sum Insured at the commencement of any Damage, Our liability will not exceed that proportion of the amount of the Damage which the Sum Insured bears to the sum representing the total cost of reinstating the whole of such Property at that time. iii No payment beyond the amount which would have been payable in the absence of this Policy Definition will be made:  a unless reinstatement commences and proceeds without unreasonable delay;  b until the cost of reinstatement will have been actually incurred; or  c if the Property insured at the time of the Damage will be insured by any other insurance effected by You or on Your behalf which is not upon the same basis of reinstatement; iv All the terms and conditions of this Policy will apply:  a in respect of any claim payable under the provisions of this Policy Definition except insofar as they are varied hereby; or  b where claims are payable as if this Policy Definition had not been incorporated.
