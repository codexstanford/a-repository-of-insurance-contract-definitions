means the document provided by your previous insurer confirming the number of years you or a named insured person has been driving each of your vehicles without making a claim. We will price your insurance based on your driving record and will not always ask for sight of this document. Should your policy be cancelled or lapsed, we will confirm the number of years you have been incident free whilst insured with us. We will only add these years to your previous no claims discount document if we have sight of the document from your last insurer.
