refers to treatment by a registered physiotherapist following referral by a medical practitioner. Physiotherapy is initially restricted to 12 sessions per condition, after which the treatment must be reviewed by the referring medical practitioner. Should further sessions be required, a progress report must be submitted to the COMPANY, which indicates the medical necessity for any further treatment. Physiotherapy does not include therapies such as Rolfing, Massage, Pilates, Fango and Milta therapy.
