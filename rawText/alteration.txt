means the medication usage, dosage or type has been increased, decreased or stopped and/or a new medication has been prescribed. Alteration does not include: a) Changes in brand due solely to the availability of your usual brand or due to a change from a brand name medication to an equivalent generic brand medication of the same usage or dosage; and b) The routine adjustment of the dosage within prescribed parameters to ensure correct blood levels are maintained when you are taking insulin or oral diabetes medication or blood thinner medication such as Coumadin/Warfarin and your blood levels must be checked regularly and your condition remains unchanged; and c) The usage changes due to the combination of several medications into one and your condition remains unchanged.
