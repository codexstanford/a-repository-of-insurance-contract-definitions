We will Index-link the sums insured for Contents, Personal Possessions and Specified Items. This means that the sums insured are linked to the consumer durables section of the retail price Index and will be automatically adjusted each month in-line with increases in these indices. However, if the indices fall We will not reduce the sums insured in line with the fall.
