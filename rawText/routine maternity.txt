refers to any medically necessary costs incurred during pregnancy and childbirth, including hospital charges, specialist fees, the mother’s pre- and post-natal care, midwife fees (during labor only) as well as newborn care. Costs related to complications of pregnancy or complications of childbirth are not payable under routine maternity. In addition, any non-medically necessary cesarean sections will be covered up to the cost of a routine delivery in the same hospital, subject to any benefit limit in place. If the home delivery benefit is included in the INSURED PERSON’s plan, a lump sum up to the amount specified in the Table of Benefits will be paid in the event of a home delivery. Please note that for multiple birth babies born as a result of medically assisted reproduction, in-patient treatment is limited to US$40,500 per child for the first three months following birth. Out-patient treatment is paid within the terms of the Out-patient Plan.
