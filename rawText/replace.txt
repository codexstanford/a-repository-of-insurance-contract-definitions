Means to repair, replace or rebuild the portion of the property suffering loss to a condition that is substantially the same as, but not better or more extensive than, when the property was new – subject to any characteristics of the property existing immediately prior to the event causing loss for which cover is excluded under this policy. A property will be considered ‘substantially the same’ if, without limitation, the size, dimensions, shape, functionality, materials, foundations, access or services, or their qualities are not materially different from your property’s characteristics immediately prior to the loss. If you choose, and we agree, we will match existing materials and building methods where current materials available within New Zealand and current building methods used in New Zealand allow. If you choose, and we agree, to repair, replace or rebuild to a condition that is not considered ‘substantially the same’, we will only be liable to pay the reasonable cost to repair or replace the property as estimated by an appropriately qualified party appointed by us to ‘substantially the same’ condition.
