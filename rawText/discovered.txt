means when a director, equity partner, member, officer or senior manager of the Company (not in collusion with a dishonest Employee) first becomes aware of facts which would cause a reasonable person to believe that Fidelity Loss covered is likely to be incurred, regardless of when the act or acts causing or contributing to such Fidelity Loss occurred even though the exact amount or details of Fidelity Loss may not then be known. Discovery also means when the Insured receives notice of an actual or potential claim against it alleging facts that if true would constitute a covered Fidelity Loss. Discovery made by one Company shall constitute Discovery made by every Company.
