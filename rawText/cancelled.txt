Not going ahead with the wedding or wedding reception before its commencement but with an intention to rearrange it at a later date (except in the case of death or severe illness of either of the couple). A wedding and wedding reception is deemed by this policy to commence at the time it is due to start or when it has started, whichever is later. A wedding or wedding reception cannot be cancelled once it has started, only curtailed.
