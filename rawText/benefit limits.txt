means the total amount payable per claim or per Condition per each section of coverage. The maximum Benefit Limit that We will pay for a single Condition, a Recurring Condition or a Chronic Condition suffered by Your Pet is the maximum Benefit Limit that was current in the Policy Period when the Condition first manifested, as stated in Your policy Schedule. If You stop making premium payments to Us then cover for any ongoing Conditions will cease. Benefit Limits are reduced in accordance with applicable deductions and not renewed on a monthly basis.
