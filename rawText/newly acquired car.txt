means a car newly owned by you. A car ceases to be a newly acquired car on the earlier of: 1. the effective date and time of a policy, includ- ing any binder, issued by us or any other com- pany that describes the car as an insured vehicle; or 2. the end of the 14th calendar day immediately following the date the car is delivered to you. If a newly acquired car is not otherwise afforded comprehensive coverage or collision coverage by this or any other policy, then this policy will provide Comprehensive Coverage or Collision Coverage for that newly acquired car, subject to a deductible of $500. Any coverage provided as a result of this paragraph will apply only until the end of the 5th calendar day immediately following the date the newly acquired car is delivered to you.
