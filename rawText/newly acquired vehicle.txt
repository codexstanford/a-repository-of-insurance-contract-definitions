1. Newly acquired vehicle means a vehicle, not insured under another policy, that is acquired by you or any family member during the policy period and is: a. A private passenger auto, pickup, trailer, or van; b. A miscellaneous vehicle that is not used in any business or occupation; or c. A motorcycle, but only if a motorcycle is shown on the current Declarations. 2. We will automatically provide for the newly acquired vehicle the broadest coverages as are provided for any vehicle shown on the Declarations. If your policy does not provide Comprehensive Coverage or Collision Coverage, we will automatically provide these coverages for the newly acquired vehicle subject to a $500 deductible for each loss. 3. Any automatic provision of coverage under J.2. will apply for up to 30 days after the date you or a family member becomes the owner of the newly acquired vehicle. If you wish to continue coverage for the newly acquired vehicle beyond this 30-day period, you must request it during this 30-day period, and we must agree to provide the coverage you request for this vehicle. If you request coverage after this 30-day period, any coverage that we agree to provide will be effective at the date and time of your request unless we agree to an earlier date.
