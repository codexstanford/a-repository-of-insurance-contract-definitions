Please note that the hospital accommodation benefit only applies where no other benefit included in the INSURED PERSON’s plan covers the required in-patient treatment. In this case, hospital accommodation costs will be covered under the more specific in-patient benefit, up to the benefit limit stated. Psychiatry and psychotherapy, organ transplant, oncology, routine maternity, palliative care and long term care are examples of in-patient benefits which include cover for hospital accommodation costs, up to the benefit limit stated, where included in the INSURED PERSON’s plan.
