Incidents which occurred in the last 3 years applicable to the policyholder as well as any drivers which are listed on the policy need to be disclosed to MiWay and should be noted on the Coversheet. An incident relates to any accident, loss or event that the policyholder or anyone covered under this policy, may have suffered irrespective of whether a claim was submitted or not or whether the item/life was insured at the time or not. Incidents or losses suffered by the aforementioned individuals in their personal capacity are not relevant. Typical examples where the incident must be disclosed: • A business employee drove a vehicle owned by the policyholder and hit a pothole damaging the vehicle's wheel and rim. The policyholder decided not to claim from its insurer and repaired/replaced the damaged items itself (irrespective of whether a claim was submitted or not) • The business owner's daughter, who is being covered under this policy as a single regular driver, had an accident whilst driving her company vehicle which was not insured (irrespective of whether the item was insured or not) • There had been an attempted break-in at the policyholder's premises and the locks and intercom system were damaged. The policyholder replaced the locks as the damage was less than the excess it had to pay on the claim (irrespective of whether the claim was paid or not)
