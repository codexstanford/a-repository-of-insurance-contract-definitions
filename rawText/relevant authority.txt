A relevant authority can be defined as any authority that has the legal power to close your venue due to a specific issue identified at that venue (e.g. Fire Brigade, Police, Local Health Authority etc). Please note this does not extend to mass venue closures arising from any government Act, regulation or change of law and that are enforced nationally or regionally.
