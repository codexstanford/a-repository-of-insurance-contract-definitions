means the right to recoup the expenses we incurred in providing cover for any accidental loss or damage to your vehicle or in covering any of your legal liability costs after a claimable event. A recoverable event does not include: • an at-fault claim; • a not at-fault claim where you are unable to provide us with the responsible party’s name, address and vehicle registration number (or any other information that would reasonably allow us to identify the person so that we can exercise our rights of recovery); • any storm or naturally occurring event, or a collision with an animal; or • any other claim that we determine is not a recoverable event at the time of considering the claim. (Your no claim bonus may be affected and an excess may be required for any claimable event that is not recoverable by us, unless otherwise stated in your policy).
