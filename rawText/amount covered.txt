when used in relation to your car, it is the maximum amount we will pay for loss or damage to your car caused by an incident covered under your policy less any deductions that apply (please see page 40 for amounts that are deducted on a total loss settlement), unless we say otherwise in your policy. It includes the value of any options, accessories and modifications that are fitted to your car, registration and compulsory third party insurance. The amount covered includes or excludes GST depending on your Input Tax Credit entitlement (refer to section ‘How the Goods and Services Tax (GST) affects this insurance’ for further detail). Your amount covered will be shown on your certificate of insurance.
