This means rental and other related costs that you have to pay at the location of your temporary accommodation. These costs are additional to those you would otherwise have had to pay. For example, if you are a tenant and the rent is higher at your temporary accommodation, weâ€™ll reimburse the difference between your new and old rents. We may also cover related costs such as those for mail forwarding, additional gas or electricity, and bonds for temporary accommodation.
