refer to the reasonable transportation costs of all INSURED family persons of the evacuated or repatriated person, including, but not limited to, minors who might otherwise be left unattended. If this cannot take place in the same transportation vehicle, round trip transport at economy rates will be paid for. In the event of an INSURED PERSON’s repatriation, the reasonable transportation costs of insured family PERSONS will only be covered if the optional Repatriation Plan forms part of the INSURED PERSON’s cover. Cover does not extend to hotel accommodation or other related expenses.
