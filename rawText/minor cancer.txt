a) Carcinoma-in-situ (CIS): means the focal autonomous new growth of carcinomatous cells confined to the cells in which it originated and has not yet resulted in the invasion and / or destruction of surrounding tissues. The diagnosis of the CIS must always be supported by a histopathological report. In the case of the cervix uteri, Pap smear alone is not acceptable and should be accompanied with cone biopsy or colposcopy with the cervical biopsy report clearly indicating presence of CIS. Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) classification which reports CIN I, CIN II and CIN III (where there is severe dysplasia without Carcinoma-in-situ) does not meet the required definition and are specifically excluded; b) Early chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) RAI Stage 1 or 2. CLL RAI stage 0 or lower is excluded; c) Malignant melanoma diagnosed based on biopsy report that has not invaded beyond epidermis. Non-melanoma skin conditions are specifically excluded; d) Early prostate cancer: Prostate cancer that is histologically described using the TNM Classification as T1N0M0; e) Early thyroid cancer: Thyroid cancer that is histologically described using the TNM Classification as T1N0M0 as well as papillary micro carcinoma of thyroid that is less than 2cm in diameter; f) Early bladder cancer: Bladder cancer that is histologically described using the TNM Classification as T1N0M0 as well as Papillary micro carcinoma of bladder.
