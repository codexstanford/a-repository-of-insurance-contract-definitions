refers to the hospital accommodation costs of one parent for the duration of the insured childâ€™s admission to hospital for eligible treatment. If a suitable bed is not available in the hospital, the COMPANY will contribute the equivalent of a three star hotel daily room rate towards any hotel costs incurred. The COMPANY will not, however, cover sundry expenses including, but not limited to, meals, telephone calls or newspapers. The INSURED PERSON(S) should check the Table of Benefits to confirm whether an age limit applies with regard to their child.
